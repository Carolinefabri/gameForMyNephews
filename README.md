## Introduction

This JavaScript-based logic game is a dedication to my nephews. I've designed this game to provide them with a fun and interactive experience. To make it even more special, I've incorporated their photos as characters in the game.

## Game Overview

**Crossing the Road** is an exciting logic game where players must safely navigate a bustling road filled with moving cars. The goal is to guide the characters (based on my nephews' photos) across the road without getting hit by the cars. The game offers the following key features:

## Game Logic

### Characters
- The game features characters represented by the photos of my nephews.
- Each character has a unique starting position on one side of the road.

### Movement
- Players control the characters using keyboard inputs.
- The UP_ARROW key moves the character upwards.
- The DOWN_ARROW key moves the character downwards.
- Characters can only move within certain bounds to avoid collisions with the road's edges.

### Obstacle Avoidance
- The game includes cars that move horizontally across the road.
- The challenge is to avoid colliding with the cars while crossing the road.
- If a collision occurs, the character is returned to the starting position.

### Scoring
- Players earn points for successfully navigating across the road.
- The game keeps track of the player's score, displayed on the screen.
- Bonus points may be awarded for reaching specific milestones.

### Gameplay Flow
- The game progresses as players skillfully maneuver their characters across the road.
- The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible score without getting hit by cars.
- Points are awarded for successful crossings, adding to the competitive aspect of the game.
